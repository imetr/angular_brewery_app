# AngularCoolApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

 The main purpose of this app development was to get in touch with Angular as development framework.
 Here I have used SCSS stylesheet format. Some examples are included using:
 `one way data binding`
 `two way data binding`
 `conditional rendering using [ngIf]`
 `style bindings using [ngStyle]`
 `class bindings using [ngClass]`
 `services`
 
 This app uses an open Api ` 'https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers?brewed_before=11-2012&abv_gt=6' ` to get brews.


## Install Dependencies

Run `npm install`  

## Development server

  
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`, or run `ng serve -o` it will open your browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

 

## Code scaffolding
  

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

  

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
